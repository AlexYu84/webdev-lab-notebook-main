This overall section was very straight forward in what it wanted us to learn and do.

For this weeks lab, it was also really straight forward in what needed to be done. It was simply following the directions the errors gave and go in and fix them accordingly.

## CSS

CSS is one of those things for me where it is a trial and error. A lot of the busy work so far has been CSS where you need to look back and forth a lot to see and get your results. 

## Flexbox

Flexboxes are new to me. I've done a good amount of web development before this class and this one was something I don't believe I have ever used before and it was great to learn. I am curious on how I can put it to use in the future.

## CSS-Grind

Similar to week 2 CSS, a lot of the work that needed to be done was just comparing my result with the images. Trial and error.

# Bootstrap

Bootstrap had a little difficult learning curve for me since this is something I am not familiar with. However, once I started to get the hang of it it made a lot of sense with its applications.

# Javascript

As usual from whaat I've learned in the past, javascript is definitely the most difficult part of web developement to grasp for me. But thankfully I've done enough of it in the past a long with other similar languages to understand everything within this section.
